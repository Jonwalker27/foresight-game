# FORESIGHT: Dimensional Intelligence Training

FORESIGHT is a web-based game designed to train and enhance your dimensional intelligence - the ability to see patterns others miss and anticipate what's coming before it fully emerges. This game is inspired by the INSTINCT Dimensional Intelligence Framework, which explores how exceptional performers in various fields demonstrate enhanced pattern recognition and information processing capabilities.

## Game Concept

The game challenges players to identify emerging patterns and predict their completion points before they fully manifest. This simulates the way elite performers like top athletes, innovative entrepreneurs, and exceptional leaders seem to "see around corners" and anticipate developments before others.

## Key Features

- **Pattern Anticipation:** Identify patterns as they emerge and predict where they'll complete
- **Progressive Difficulty:** 10 levels with increasing complexity, speed, and cognitive load
- **Multiple Pattern Types:** Sequence patterns, geometric patterns, and convergence patterns
- **Signal-to-Noise Filtering:** Learn to focus on meaningful signals while filtering out distractions
- **Performance Rating:** Get feedback on your dimensional intelligence capabilities

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Make sure the p5.js library is included:
   - Either place p5.min.js in the /lib folder
   - Or use the CDN link in index.html
3. Open index.html in a modern web browser

## How to Play

1. **Pattern Recognition Phase:**
   - Watch as patterns begin to emerge on screen
   - Pay attention to the underlying logic and pattern structure
   
2. **Prediction Phase:**
   - Before a pattern completes, you'll enter the prediction phase
   - A pulsing indicator will appear
   - Click where you believe the pattern will complete
   
3. **Scoring:**
   - Earn points for correct predictions
   - Get time bonuses for quicker predictions
   - Advance through levels by reaching target scores

## Pattern Types

- **Sequence Patterns:** Follow predictable sequences that you must complete
- **Geometric Patterns:** Based on geometric shapes and symmetry
- **Convergence Patterns:** Multiple elements that converge to a single point

## The Science Behind the Game

This game is based on the INSTINCT Dimensional Intelligence Framework, which explores how elite performers process information differently:

1. **Enhanced pattern recognition across domains**
2. **Processing multiple variables simultaneously rather than sequentially**
3. **Detecting weak signals that others filter out as noise**
4. **Anticipating developments before they become obvious to others**
5. **Recognizing similarities in pattern structures across seemingly unrelated domains**

Regular practice with these types of pattern recognition challenges may help develop the perceptual frameworks that exceptional performers utilize.
